# Verification Checklist

## ✅ Setup Complete

This boilerplate has been verified and is ready for development.

### Verified Components

- ✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: All types check correctly
- ✅ **ESLint**: No linting errors
- ✅ **Dependencies**: All packages installed
- ✅ **Git Hooks**: Husky configured
- ✅ **Configuration Files**: All configs in place

### Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Type checking
npm run type-check
# Should exit with code 0 (no errors)

# Linting
npm run lint
# Should exit with code 0 (no errors)

# Test compilation
npm run build
# Should build successfully
```

### Next Steps

1. **Set up environment variables**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Supabase credentials
   ```

2. **Start development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The TanStack Router route tree will be automatically generated on first run.

3. **Run tests** (optional):

   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

4. **Start Storybook** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm run storybook
   ```

### Known Notes

- **ESLint Version**: Using ESLint 8 for compatibility with TypeScript ESLint plugins
- **Peer Dependencies**: If you encounter conflicts during `npm install`, use `--legacy-peer-deps`
